    Okay, after all that, we should have a pretty good working, consistently running version of nek5000 in this push. Big fixes include, by my recollection. 1). Removing the exit call that ended the run after the PRE COLLISIONS phase and 2). Having a directory where nek5000 can actually find the rea file, though I'm not sure why it can't sometimes. I've zipped this directory in my quartz workspace, as I really want to clean all of this up, but I'll be really ticked if this breaks something. If all goes well, the next steps will be 1). Updating the wrapper and generate functions to make sure they work correctly, and that they are updated with the new parameter space. 2). Integrating the new files that Sai has to send me, namely the SIZE and .box file, to ensure that we've got the right problem. Also, just removed the small cases tarball because git has problems with such large file sizes. Should proably do something similar with log files. Also, had to get rid of some of those nek5000 executables, because those suckers are pretty big too.

    Ok, I'm probably gonna have to do a merge, but I'm making different folders in the run example folder for both the local worskpace on my lab desktop, and on quartz.

    Getting weird error messsages on quartz when I run. Just ran on workhorse, and it ran to completion. Because of that, I'm pushing this working version to pull on quartz, to see if it fixes anything.

    Merge branch 'main_instrumentation' of https://github.com/Knoxort/cmt_Nek_BE_Instrumentation into main_instrumentation
    Trying to add the run folder, which was held back by some .gitignore nonsense.

    Basically just removing the ignore files, and then using the -f option to ensure that the run folder is being uploaded, unlike last time. Github told me to use the -f option; I'm not sure where these ignore files are coming from.

    Delete .gitignore
    
    Same as master branch; not sure why this was here.

    Added Sai's version of the LPM and lpm.f files, which should include the new kind of instrumentation implementation that he wants.

    Added some work on the input passing. As of now, seems to work correctly. Was going to move towards kernel extraction, but, after talking to Sai, it seems that this is no longer necessary. Finished by finding the root of the quirk where n is always equal to 0. Still not 100% sure how it started; there's a bit too much for me to think that I randomly commented something out. Also, from the way that I fixed it, I'm not 100% sure that everything works properly. When we get to submitting, should check against David's code.

    First commit; this is for a CMT-nek 4 way coupling repo for the BE group, specifically to focus on the instrumentation for kernel performance models.
